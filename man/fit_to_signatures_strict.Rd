\title{Fit mutational signatures to a mutation matrix with less overfitting}
\usage{
fit_to_signatures_strict(mut_matrix, signatures, max_delta = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{mut_matrix}{mutation count matrix (dimensions: x mutation types
X n samples)}

\item{signatures}{Signature matrix (dimensions: x mutation types
X n signatures)}

\item{max_delta}{The maximum difference in original vs reconstructed cosine similarity between two iterations.}
}
\value{
A list containing a fit_res object, similar to `fit_to_signatures` and a list of ggplot graphs
that for each sample shows in what order the signatures were removed and how this affected the cosine similarity.
}
\description{
Find a linear non-negative combination of mutation signatures that
reconstructs the mutation matrix. First an optimal reconstruction is achieved via `fit_to_signatures`.
However, this is prone to overfitting. 
To solve this the signature with the lowest contribution is removed and refitting is repeated.
This is done in an iterative fashion. 
Each time the cosine similarity between the original and reconstructed profile is calculated.
Iterations are stopped when the difference between two iterations becomes more than `max_delta`.
The second-last set of signatures is then used for a final refit.
}
\examples{
## See the 'mut_matrix()' example for how we obtained the mutation matrix:
mut_mat <- readRDS(system.file("states/mut_mat_data.rds",
                    package="MutationalPatterns"))

## You can download the signatures from the COSMIC website:
# https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures

## We copied the file into our package for your convenience.
filename <- system.file("extdata/snv_signatures_probabilities.txt",
                        package="MutationalPatterns")
signatures <- read.table(filename, sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

## Remove unnecessary columns
signatures = as.matrix(signatures[,-c(1,2)])

## Fit to signatures strict
strict_refit = fit_to_signatures_strict(mut_mat, signatures, max_delta = 0.05)

## fit_res similar to 'fit_to_signatures()'
fit_res = strict_refit$fit_res

## list of ggplots that shows how the cosine similarity was reduced during the iterations
fig_l = strict_refit$sim_decay_fig
